Project Summary

The purpose of this project is to calculate the sales revenue of sellers.
This project showcased Dart with Mixins, Classes, Extensions, and Try...Catch, and an If-else-if condition.

Detailed Explanation:

- The Product uses 'Mixin, Class' to describe products as follows:

  -   Set of product types.
  -   Mixin is used to create the price
  -   Class ProductDescription used to describe the product with three instances: nameOfProduct, price, and year produced.
  -   Class Car, Class Laptop, and Class iPad are inherited from Class ProductDescription.

- The Seller also uses the `Mixin ' class to describe seller information with four instances. Mixin is also used to create firstName, lastName, fullName, and email, and to validate the email.

- The project imports the product and seller to extract information about the product and seller. In the project, the class TotalSale is created to calculate the total sale of the seller. In this project, try...catch and if-else if conditions are used to handle the wrong cases in calculating TotalSale.
